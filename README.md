# Hooker Map

`Hooker Index = Median net income per year / Median hooker rate per hour`

## Story

I am a long time subscriver of [r/MapPorn]() on Reddit.
Several days ago I saw a post titled
[
  "How many times per month you can afford hooker with your country's average monthly wage
  considering that average hooker costs €50 for half hour(€100 for Switzerland)"
](
  https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/7i7vas/how_many_times_per_month_you_can_afford_hooker/
) (the image has been already deleted).

I thought that it is curious, but that post was really terrible.
So I decided to create a new one but more accurate:
1. I decided to find actual costs, instead of this weak assumption _"€50 for half hour(€100 for Switzerland)"_.
2. I think that median net income makes more sense than average wage in this case.

## Sources

Median net income data is from Eurostat: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gdp-and-beyond/quality-of-life/median-income

Median hooker rate per hour is scrapped from various websites.
